# Robo_V_Dino

This program is my submission for the Robot Vs. Dinosaur project for devCodeCamp!
This program is meant to prove my knowledge of the use of classes within Python.

In the program, I utilized the time function on multiple occasions. Hence, if it seems like the program stalled out, it did not.
